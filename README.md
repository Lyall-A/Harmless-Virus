This is a harmless virus :)
Do not worry!

The "kill_pc" file will close explorer so your PC screen will be all black or a color. Most off the softwares you had open will stil be open as well. If you want to fix this open the "fix_pc" file or you can follow these steps: hold down on control and alt then click delete, a screen will pop up then you click on "task manager". Once you are on task manager click "File" then "Run new task", in the box that pops up type explorer.exe then hit enter and thats it your PC is back to normal!

The "fix_pc" file will open explorer and fix your PC. (this only works on the "kill_pc" file!)

The "crash_pc" file will open thousands of command prompts and crash your PC! (this can only be fixed when you restart your PC!)

Thats it enjoy :)
